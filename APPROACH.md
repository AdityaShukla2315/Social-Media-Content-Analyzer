# Development Approach

## Problem Statement
Content creators struggle to optimize their social media posts for maximum engagement. They need a tool that can analyze existing content and provide actionable insights to improve performance across different platforms.

## Solution Strategy
I built a full-stack web application that combines document processing with AI-powered content analysis. The approach focuses on three core functionalities: content extraction, intelligent analysis, and user-friendly presentation.

## Technical Implementation
The frontend uses React with a step-by-step workflow to guide users through the process. I implemented drag-and-drop file uploads using react-dropzone and integrated Tesseract.js for OCR capabilities. The backend leverages Express.js with dedicated routes for PDF parsing, image processing, and AI analysis.

For the AI component, I integrated Google Gemini API to analyze content tone, sentiment, and engagement potential. The system provides platform-specific recommendations for Twitter, LinkedIn, Instagram, and Facebook.

## Key Design Decisions
- Modular architecture with separate components for each feature
- Real-time feedback with loading states and progress indicators
- Dark/light theme support for better user experience
- Responsive design ensuring mobile compatibility
- Auto-scroll functionality to guide users through the analysis process

The result is an intuitive tool that transforms raw content into actionable social media insights.
